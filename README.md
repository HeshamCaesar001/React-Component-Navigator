# React Component Showcase

Welcome to the React Component Showcase! This project demonstrates a collection of UI components built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. The project highlights various concepts in React, such as component composition, state management, hooks, and routing.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a gallery of reusable components that you can explore and interact with. It includes a navigation sidebar for easy access to different components, such as:

- **Dropdown**
- **Buttons**
- **Accordion**
- **Modal**
- **Table**
- **Sortable Table**
- **Link**
- **Panel**
- **Route**
- **Sidebar**

Each component is encapsulated within its own file under the `components` folder, and the project structure promotes modularity and reusability.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **components**: Contains all the reusable UI components.
- **hooks**: Contains custom React hooks used throughout the application.
- **context**: Contains context providers to manage global state.
- **pages**: Contains the pages that render different sets of components.
